# PDS_Project

The project is divided into 5 parts.

1. Data Loading: A function (upload_files) is developed by Ali for loading of the data from multiple files in one dataframe.
2. Data Cleaning: A function (clean_data) is developed by Usman for cleaning of the dataframe that was returned from the upload_files function.
3. Descriptive and Graphical Analysis: Two separate functions encompassing several functions are developed by Faraz for analysis of the data.
4. KPIs: Calculations of different KPIs to better understand the key points in the data were then calculated by Hammad from the clean dataframe received from clean_data function
5. Visualizations: 4 key graphs were developed by Hassan to visualize key parameters in the data by Hassan.

The program execution starts from line 412 and calls the above mentioned functions in the order of their use and ends with a print statement stating that the program has ended.
